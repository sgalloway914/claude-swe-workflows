# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is `claude-swe-workflows`, a Claude Code plugin for software engineering workflows. It provides skills and agents that extend Claude Code's capabilities for systematic development.

## Plugin Structure

```

├── agents/              # Agent definitions
│   └── agent-name.md    # Agent prompt with YAML frontmatter
├── skills/              # Skill definitions

└── README.md
```

## Development

Test the plugin locally:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir .
```

## Writing Skills and Agents

**Skills** (in `skills/*/SKILL.md`):
- YAML frontmatter: `name`, `description`, `model` (opus/sonnet/haiku - lowercase)
- Invoked by user with `/skill-name`
- Define workflows, processes, or specialized behaviors

**Agents** (in `agents/*.md`):
- YAML frontmatter: `name`, `description`, `model` (lowercase)
- Spawned programmatically via `Task` tool with `subagent_type`
- Operate autonomously within defined scope

**Model names must be lowercase** (`opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`) - capitalized names are not recognized.

## Workflow

The skills form a three-stage development workflow:

```
/deliberate  →  /scope  →  /iterate
   decide        plan      implement
```

Skills: `/deliberate` (adversarial decision-making), `/scope` (planning), `/iterate` (implementation), `/bugfix` (bug-fixing), `/project` (multi-ticket orchestration), `/refactor` (tactical cleanup), `/arch-review` (architectural restructuring), `/test-review` (comprehensive test suite review), `/test-mutate` (mutation testing), `/release-review` (pre-release readiness), and `/doc-review` (documentation audit), plus specialist agents.
