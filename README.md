## Skills

### /deliberate - Adversarial Decision Making

Uses adversarial representation to make decisions. Spawns advocate agents for each option who argue their cases, rebut each other, and respond to probing questions before a judge (Claude) renders a verdict with reasoning and trade-offs.

**Use when:**
- Vendor/tool/library selection
- Architectural decisions with multiple valid approaches
- Build vs buy decisions
- Technology stack choices
- Strategic decisions with trade-offs

**Don't use when:**
- Decisions with a clearly correct answer
- Simple preferences (just ask directly)
- Decisions requiring real-world testing to resolve

### /iterate - Automated Development Workflow

Orchestrates a complete development cycle through specialist agents: requirements → planning → implementation → QA → code review → documentation.

**Use when:**
- Building non-trivial features requiring multiple files
- You want quality gates (testing, security review, refactoring suggestions)
- Changes benefit from specialist review (Go, GraphQL, Docker, etc.)
- Practical verification matters (CLI tools, MCP servers, APIs)

**Don't use when:**
- Simple one-line fixes or typos
- Quick prototyping or throwaway code
- Overhead outweighs benefit

[Detailed documentation](skills/iterate/README.md)

### /scope - Problem Space Exploration

Explores problem spaces through iterative dialogue and codebase analysis, then creates detailed tickets in your issue tracker.

**Use when:**
- Planning a complex feature before implementation
- Investigating a bug and documenting findings
- Exploring refactoring opportunities
- Creating well-specified tickets for later implementation

**Key principle:** `/scope` explores and documents. It does NOT implement.

[Detailed documentation](skills/scope/README.md)

### /refactor - Iterative Code Quality Improvement

Iteratively scans for tactical code quality improvements (DRY, dead code, naming, complexity), implements through specialist agents with QA verification, and loops until no improvements remain. Works within existing architecture.

**Use when:**
- Cleaning up accumulated technical debt
- After a major feature is complete and you want to tidy up
- Routine DRY, dead code, naming, and complexity fixes
- You want a quick, low-risk cleanup pass

**Key principle:** Clarity through red diffs. Always make the least aggressive change available first, and work upward.

[Detailed documentation](skills/refactor/README.md)

### /arch-review - Blueprint-Driven Architectural Improvement

Analyzes codebase architecture via noun analysis, produces a target blueprint, then collaborates with the user to review, refine, and decide what to implement. Changes are made through specialist agents with QA verification.

**Use when:**
- Module boundaries are unclear or responsibilities overlap
- The codebase has grown organically and needs structural rethinking
- Utility grab-bags ("helpers", "utils") need dissolution
- Preparing a codebase for a major new feature that needs clean abstractions

**Key principle:** Recommend boldly, implement collaboratively. The analysis agent surfaces every opportunity; the user decides what to act on.

[Detailed documentation](skills/arch-review/README.md)

### /test-review - Comprehensive Test Suite Review

Three-phase test suite review: fills coverage gaps, identifies missing fuzz tests, and audits test quality. Each phase has its own analysis → present → select → implement → verify cycle.

**Use when:**
- Coverage metrics are below target or you're onboarding to an under-tested codebase
- After a burst of agent-written tests that may need quality review
- Before a release, to strengthen and clean up the test suite
- Periodically, as a comprehensive test health check

**Key principle:** Tests are a system, not a checklist. Add what's missing, then clean up what's broken.

[Detailed documentation](skills/test-review/README.md)

### /release-review - Pre-Release Readiness Check

Comprehensive pre-flight check before cutting a release. Scans for debug artifacts, version mismatches, changelog gaps, git hygiene issues, breaking API changes, and license compliance. Runs test suite and build verification. Checks documentation freshness. Interactive — presents findings and lets you decide what to fix.

**Use when:**
- Preparing to tag and release a new version
- Final quality gate before shipping to users
- Validating that a codebase is ready for distribution

**Key principle:** Surface issues, don't silently fix them. Releases deserve human review.

[Detailed documentation](skills/release-review/README.md)

### /test-mutate - Mutation Testing Workflow

Systematically introduces mutations (small deliberate changes) into source code and checks if tests catch them. Surviving mutations reveal genuine coverage gaps that line coverage misses. Multi-session with progress tracking.

**Use when:**
- Verifying test quality for critical code (auth, payment, data processing)
- Finding blind spots that line coverage metrics miss
- Quality gate before shipping high-stakes changes
- After refactoring, to ensure tests still catch bugs

**Key principle:** Mutation score > line coverage. Tests that run code without asserting on behavior give false confidence.

[Detailed documentation](skills/test-mutate/README.md)

### /bugfix - Automated Bug-Fixing Workflow

Coordinates specialist agents through a bug-fixing cycle: clarify bug, reproduce with failing test, diagnose root cause, implement fix, verify, review, and document. Uses `swe-diagnostician` for root-cause analysis and the appropriate SME for implementation.

**Use when:**
- Fixing a bug that warrants thorough investigation
- You want test-driven reproduction before implementing a fix
- The bug may have related failure modes worth investigating
- You want regression tests alongside the fix

**Key principle:** Diagnose before you fix. Understand why a bug exists, not just what to change.

[Detailed documentation](skills/bugfix/README.md)

### /project - Multi-Ticket Orchestration

Orchestrates a batch of tickets as a cohesive project. Creates a project branch, implements each ticket sequentially using `/iterate` in autonomous mode, runs cross-cutting quality passes (`/refactor`, `/doc-review`), and presents results for final human review.

**Use when:**
- Implementing a batch of related tickets from your issue tracker
- You want autonomous execution with a single review point at the end
- Multiple tickets share a milestone, tag, or feature area

**Key principle:** Maximize autonomy, minimize accumulated error. Pull the andon cord immediately when something goes wrong.

[Detailed documentation](skills/project/README.md)

### /doc-review - Documentation Quality Audit

Spawns a doc-maintainer agent to comprehensively review all project documentation for correctness, completeness, and freshness. Fixes issues autonomously within its authority.

**Use when:**
- After refactoring or architectural changes that may have staled documentation
- As a standalone documentation audit
- Called automatically by `/refactor` and `/arch-review` after completion

**Key principle:** Documentation should reflect the actual state of the codebase, not an aspirational one.

## Workflow Integration

The skills form a three-stage workflow:

```
/deliberate  →  /scope  →  /iterate
   decide        plan      implement
```

Use `/deliberate` to resolve architectural questions, `/scope` to explore and
create tickets, and `/iterate` to implement.

Enter at any stage. Complex decisions benefit from the full workflow.
Straightforward changes can go directly to `/iterate`.

## Development

See [HACKING.md](HACKING.md) for local development and testing instructions.

## Requirements

- `git` repository
- For ticket creation: integration with your issue tracker (CLI, MCP server, or API)
