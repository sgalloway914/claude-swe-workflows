# Bug Hunt — Proactive Bug Discovery

Systematically hunts for bugs before they reach users. An assessor analyzes the codebase to identify high-risk hotspots by cross-referencing code complexity, test coverage gaps, and structural risk factors. Focused hunters then deep-dive into each hotspot, writing reproducing tests to validate or invalidate suspected bugs.

**This is deliberately thorough.** Each suspected bug gets a reproducing test — no speculative reports. The goal is confirmed findings with evidence, not a noisy list of maybes.

## Workflow Details

### 1. Determine Scope

**Default:** Production code only. Excluded by default:
- Test code (test files, test fixtures, test helpers)
- Dev-only dependencies and tooling
- Generated code, vendored code

Inform the user of these exclusions.

**Ask the user:**
- "What is the scope of the hunt?" (entire codebase, specific module, specific area of concern)
- "Are there areas you're particularly worried about?" (recent changes, complex features, etc.)
- "Anything to skip beyond the defaults?"

User concerns influence prioritization but don't replace systematic analysis.

### 2. Risk Assessment

**Spawn a `swe-bug-assessor` agent:**

```
You are the risk assessor for a proactive bug hunt. Your analysis will guide
focused investigators who will deep-dive into the hotspots you identify.

Scope: [entire codebase | user-specified scope]
User concerns: [any areas mentioned, or "none specified"]
Exclusions: [test code, vendored code, generated code, plus any user additions]

Perform your full methodology:
1. Map the codebase — language, framework, structure, entry points
2. Coverage analysis — use instrumented coverage if available, fall back to
   manual inspection
3. Complexity analysis — identify functions with high cognitive complexity
4. Structural risk analysis — error handling gaps, input validation gaps,
   shared mutable state, resource management issues, concurrency risks,
   edge case blindness, consistency gaps
5. Git enrichment (optional) — churn hotspots, recent large changes
6. Cross-reference signals and produce a ranked hotspot list

Focus on hotspots where MULTIPLE signals converge — complex AND untested AND
structurally risky. Single-signal hotspots are lower priority.

Output your full assessment in your standard format.
```

**When the assessor reports back:** Review the hotspot list. This drives the investigation phase.

### 3. Focused Investigation — Hunters

**For each hotspot in the assessor's list (ALL priorities), spawn a dedicated `swe-bug-hunter` agent:**

```
You are a focused bug hunter investigating a specific hotspot.

## YOUR HOTSPOT
Target: [from assessor's report]
Files: [from assessor's report]
Risk signals: [from assessor's report]
Hypothesis: [from assessor's report]
Investigation approach: [from assessor's report]

## PRIOR FINDINGS (if any)
[Findings from previous hunters — confirmed bugs, patterns observed]

## YOUR MISSION
Deep-dive into this hotspot. Systematically probe for bugs. For each
suspected issue, write a reproducing test that encodes the correct expected
behavior.

- If the test FAILS: bug confirmed. Keep the test. Document the finding.
- If the test PASSES: hypothesis invalidated. Evaluate whether the test
  improves coverage:
  - Covers a previously untested path → keep it
  - Redundant with existing tests → delete it

Every confirmed finding must have a reproducing test. No speculative reports.

Note any patterns that might apply to other hotspots.
```

**Run hunters sequentially, not in parallel.** Each hunter's findings and pattern observations are passed to the next. This enables cross-hotspot pattern detection — if hunter 2 finds that error handling is broken in module A, hunter 5 (investigating module B which shares error-handling utilities) gets that context.

**Pass prior findings to each new hunter.** As findings accumulate, each subsequent hunter receives confirmed bugs and observed patterns from previous investigations.

### 4. Synthesize Findings

After all hunters have reported, synthesize:

**Cross-cutting analysis:**
- Do confirmed bugs share a common root cause or pattern?
- Are there systemic issues (e.g., a utility function used across 10 modules is buggy, but only one module was a hotspot)?
- Do coverage improvements from invalidated hypotheses reveal areas worth further investigation?

**Pattern escalation:**
- If multiple hunters report the same pattern (e.g., "error handling is inconsistent"), note this as a systemic issue even if individual instances are low severity
- Systemic patterns may warrant additional investigation or a follow-up `/refactor`

### 5. Present Consolidated Findings

Compile all findings into a single report:

```
## Bug Hunt Summary

Scope: [what was analyzed]
Assessment: [N hotspots identified across X files]
Hotspots investigated: [N]
Confirmed bugs: N (X critical, Y high, Z medium, W low)
Coverage improvements: N tests added
Systemic patterns: N

## CONFIRMED BUGS

### CRITICAL
- **[file:line — description]**
  - Bug: [concrete description]
  - Root cause: [why it exists]
  - Impact: [what happens in practice]
  - Reproducing test: [test file:test name]
  - Fix guidance: [what needs to change]

### HIGH
[same format]

### MEDIUM
[same format]

### LOW
[same format]

## SYSTEMIC PATTERNS

[Cross-cutting issues observed across multiple hotspots]
- [pattern] — observed in [locations] — suggests [recommendation]

## COVERAGE IMPROVEMENTS

[Tests added that didn't find bugs but improved coverage]
- [test name] in [file] — covers [what]

## SUSPECTED BUT UNCONFIRMED

[Issues suspected but not validated with tests — lower confidence]
- [description] — couldn't test because [reason]

## AREAS NOT INVESTIGATED

[Hotspots deprioritized or areas outside scope that may warrant future attention]
```

**Present to user interactively.** Walk through CRITICAL findings first. For each, explain the bug, the impact, and show the reproducing test. Let the user ask questions before moving on.

### 6. Route to Fixers (Optional)

After presenting findings, ask: "Would you like to route confirmed bugs to agents for fixing?"

**If yes:**
- For each confirmed bug, determine the appropriate fixer:
  - Detect project language and spawn the appropriate SME agent
  - Pass the bug description, root cause, reproducing test, and fix guidance
  - The reproducing test serves as the acceptance criterion — when it passes, the bug is fixed
- After each fix, spawn `qa-engineer` to verify:
  - The reproducing test now passes
  - No other tests broke
- Commit each fix atomically

**If no:** The report and reproducing tests stand on their own.

### 7. Commit Reproducing Tests (Optional)

If the user does not route to fixers (or after fixes are complete), ask: "Would you like to commit the reproducing tests? They document the bugs and improve coverage."

**If yes:**
- Commit all reproducing tests (both bug-confirming and coverage-improving) in a single commit
- Use a descriptive commit message referencing the bug hunt

**If no:** Leave tests uncommitted for the user to handle.

## Agent Coordination

**Sequential execution within investigation phase.** The assessor runs first, then hunters run sequentially so findings accumulate for pattern detection.

**Fresh instances for every agent.** Each agent gets a clean context window dedicated entirely to its task.

**State to maintain (as orchestrator):**
- Assessor's hotspot list and coverage landscape
- Each hunter's findings (accumulating — passed to subsequent hunters)
- Running totals for the summary
- List of all test files created (for commit step)
- Current hotspot count (for progress tracking)

## Abort Conditions

**Abort investigation of a hotspot:**
- Hunter reports hotspot is clean after thorough investigation (expected and fine — skip to next)

**Abort entire workflow:**
- User interrupts
- Assessor finds no significant hotspots (positive outcome — report clean assessment)
- Critical system error

**Do NOT abort for:**
- Individual clean hotspots (continue to next)
- Test infrastructure issues on a single hotspot (report as unconfirmed, continue)
- Low-confidence findings (include in report as SUSPECTED BUT UNCONFIRMED)

## Integration with Other Skills

**Relationship to `/audit-source`:**
- `/audit-source` is security-focused — blue team + red team methodology
- `/bug-hunt` targets correctness bugs — logic errors, edge cases, missing error handling
- Both can find overlapping issues, but with different lenses. `/audit-source` asks "can an attacker exploit this?" while `/bug-hunt` asks "will this fail for a normal user?"
- Run both for comprehensive pre-release assurance

**Relationship to `/bug-fix`:**
- `/bug-fix` is reactive — fixes a known, reported bug
- `/bug-hunt` is proactive — finds bugs before they're reported
- Bug hunt findings can feed into `/bug-fix` for thorough remediation of complex issues

**Relationship to `/review-test`:**
- `/review-test` focuses on test quality — coverage gaps, brittle tests, missing fuzz tests
- `/bug-hunt` uses coverage data as one input signal but focuses on finding actual bugs, not improving test quality
- The coverage improvements from `/bug-hunt` are a side effect, not the primary goal

**Relationship to `/refactor`:**
- Systemic patterns identified by `/bug-hunt` (e.g., "inconsistent error handling across 15 modules") may warrant a follow-up `/refactor`
- `/bug-hunt` identifies the pattern; `/refactor` fixes it systematically

## Example Session

```
> /bug-hunt

What is the scope of the hunt?
> Focus on the payment processing module — we've had some edge case reports

Anything you're particularly worried about?
> Currency conversion and rounding — we support 30+ currencies now

Anything to skip beyond the defaults?
> No, defaults are fine

Starting proactive bug hunt...

[Phase 1 — Risk Assessment]
Spawning assessor...

Assessment report:
  Coverage: 67% line coverage (instrumented via go test -cover)
  Hotspots identified: 8 (3 critical, 3 high, 2 medium)

  CRITICAL-1: payment/converter.go:ConvertAmount (lines 45-112)
    Signals: 0% test coverage + deep nesting (6 levels) + floating-point
      arithmetic
    Hypothesis: Currency conversion may lose precision or handle edge
      currencies incorrectly

  CRITICAL-2: payment/checkout.go:ProcessCheckout (lines 23-89)
    Signals: Partial coverage (happy path only) + error handling
      inconsistency + 3 bug-fix commits in last month
    Hypothesis: Error paths may leave order in inconsistent state

  CRITICAL-3: payment/refund.go:CalculateRefund (lines 15-78)
    Signals: No test coverage + complex conditional logic + shared mutable
      state (order object)
    Hypothesis: Partial refund calculations may be incorrect for multi-item
      orders

  HIGH-1: payment/currency/rates.go:FetchRates (lines 30-67)
    Signals: No error path tests + external API dependency + no timeout
      handling
    ...

[Phase 2 — Focused Investigation]

Spawning hunter for CRITICAL-1 (ConvertAmount)...

  Test 1: TestConvertAmount_ZeroCurrencyPrecision — FAIL
    Bug confirmed: JPY (0-decimal currency) conversion multiplies by 100
    then divides by 100, losing the original integer value for odd amounts.
    Impact: ¥101 → ¥100 (1 yen lost per odd-amount transaction)

  Test 2: TestConvertAmount_SameCurrency — PASS
    Kept: covers previously untested identity conversion path

  Test 3: TestConvertAmount_NegativeAmount — FAIL
    Bug confirmed: Negative amounts (credits/adjustments) bypass validation
    and produce positive conversion results due to Abs() call without
    sign restoration.
    Impact: -$10.00 credit → +€8.50 charge

  Test 4: TestConvertAmount_UnknownCurrency — PASS
    Kept: covers error path for unsupported currency codes

  Findings: 2 confirmed bugs, 2 coverage improvements

Spawning hunter for CRITICAL-2 (ProcessCheckout)...

  Test 1: TestProcessCheckout_PaymentFailureCleanup — FAIL
    Bug confirmed: When payment gateway returns error after inventory was
    reserved, inventory reservation is not released. Order stuck in
    "processing" state.
    Impact: Phantom inventory holds that never clear (requires manual DB fix)

  Pattern noted: cleanup-on-error-path is missing in 3 other functions
  in this package (passed to next hunter)

  ...

[Phase 3 — Synthesis]

Confirmed bugs: 7 (3 critical, 3 high, 1 medium)
Coverage improvements: 9 tests added
Systemic pattern: Error-path cleanup is missing in 5 of 12 functions
  that reserve resources — this is a codebase-wide pattern, not isolated.
